# KiddoCareHub: Intelligent Learning and Assessment System for Children

KiddoCareHub is an innovative educational platform designed to assist daycare centers by providing children with personalized learning experiences. The system uses game-based learning, AI-driven insights, and real-time data tracking to help children improve their math and English skills. 

Daycare center staff can monitor each child's learning journey, identify strengths and weaknesses, and receive AI-generated personalized learning activities. The platform supports a comprehensive learning experience for children in a fun and engaging way!

## Features

- **Engaging Gameplay**: A fun and interactive 2D game for children focused on math and English language learning.
- **Knowledge Level Analysis**: Utilizes a decision tree algorithm to assess a child's current knowledge in tested areas.
- **Web Application for Staff**: A MERN stack-based web app that allows daycare center staff to access and analyze children's game results.
- **Personalized Learning**: AI-generated learning activities tailored to each child's unique needs, powered by OpenAI.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Staff can view game sessions, filter results by student ID or name, and track individual progress over time.

## Technologies Used

1. **Unity (2D Game Development)**:
   - A 2D game built using Unity specifically designed for children, focusing on math and English language learning. The game tracks the child's performance for analysis and further development.

2. **Decision Tree Algorithm**:
   - A decision tree model analyzes the game data to determine the child's current knowledge level in math and English. This data is then stored in a MongoDB database for easy retrieval.

3. **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**:
   - A web application interface developed using the MERN stack enables daycare center staff to access detailed game results, filter by student ID or name, and monitor progress over time.

4. **MongoDB**:
   - Used for storing game results and analyzed data, offering an efficient and scalable database solution.

5. **OpenAI**:
   - The system uses OpenAI to analyze the child's learning data and generate personalized learning activities tailored to each child's unique needs. It also provides access to a database of videos to aid learning further.

## How It Works

1. **Engaging Gameplay**:
   - Children play a 2D game that tracks their performance in math and English activities.
   
2. **Data Analysis**:
   - A decision tree algorithm analyzes the game data to determine the child’s knowledge level.

3. **Web Application**:
   - Staff members log into a MERN-based web app to view and filter game results based on student ID or name. They can see performance scores, session times, and other useful metrics.

4. **Personalized Learning Activities**:
   - OpenAI generates personalized learning activities based on the child’s performance, helping them improve in areas of difficulty.
